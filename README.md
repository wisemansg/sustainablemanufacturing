🌱 MODELLING AND SIMULATION FOR SUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURING

📚 Executive Summary.

This project provides a comprehensive simulation study of the sustainable manufacturing process for automotive brake discs focusing on energy consumption, carbon footprint, and process efficiency. Using AnyLogic software and the Discrete Event Simulation (DES) methodology, key production stages including machining, inspection, reworking, packaging, and shipping were modeled for a standard 9-hour shift. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total energy consumption, renewable energy share, carbon footprint, throughput time, and scrap rate were analyzed to evaluate operational efficiency and sustainability

The simulation recorded a total energy consumption of 80,476 kWh with 70 percent from renewable sources at 56,333.2 kWh and 30 percent from non-renewable sources at 24,142.8 kWh. Carbon emissions totaled 41,764.5 kg CO₂, highlighting the impact of non-renewable energy reliance. Production efficiency was high with 85 percent of units successfully shipped, a 14 percent rework rate, and only 1 percent scrapped units, while the average throughput time was 657.7 seconds per unit. Resource utilization showed Manual Operator 1 at 74 percent, Operator 2 at 35 percent, and machines at 71 percent suggesting opportunities for workload balancing and efficiency improvements

📈 Key Results.
